Here’s what you need to know.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Fitbit Charge 4 offers the company’s “most advanced combination of sensors and features” that includes the usual suite of sensors used for tracking a user’s heart rate and other vitals, along with a few new additions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Perhaps the biggest add on the Fitbit Charge 4 is the arrival of built-in GPS. This allows Fitbit owners to track their workouts on a map while leaving their phones behind. When using the Fitbit app after a run, the data can be shown on a map that includes how intense the workout was at certain points and showing pace and distance. GPS will take a tremendous toll on battery life, though, with continuous use only lasting five hours.</p><p style=text-align:justify>GPS also enables a new “Activity Zone Minutes” feature that should help users better reach their daily goals and promote being active for at least 30 minutes per day. Fitbit explains:</p><p style=text-align:justify>Beyond the inclusion of GPS, the Fitbit Charge 4 also features some other upgrades. The tracker includes Spotify integration (pictured below) for controlling your music, Fitbit Pay for NFC payments without using your phone, and there’s also an SpO2 sensor. That sensor is used to power Fitbit’s “Estimated Oxygen Variation Graph” in the Fitbit app.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As you’d expect, features from previous Fitbit trackers such as sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate tracking, and different exercise mode are all available on the Charge 4. Battery life is rated at 7 days, too.</p><p style=text-align:justify>All of these features come standard, too, on the base model Fitbit Charge 4. There is an “SE” model, but that option only throws in an additional reflective band for $20 more. You can pre-order Charge 4 from the <a #>company’s official site</a> and <a #>Best Buy</a> now, orders are set to ship April 13. The tracker also includes a 90-day trial to Fitbit Premium.</p><div readability=241.88564086091><h3>Fitbit Introduces Fitbit Charge 4, its Most Advanced Health & Fitness Tracker with Built-in GPS, Active Zone Minutes, Spotify, Sleep Tools, Fitbit Pay and More</h3><ul><li>Launches Active Zone Minutes, a new personalized heart rate metric that tracks your physical activity beyond steps to help you move efficiently every day and improve your overall health</li><li>Fitbit Premium delivers new programs, challenges, workouts and mindfulness tools, plus free 90-day trial, giving users support and guidance to stay healthy in any environment</li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>SAN FRANCISCO — (BUSINESS WIRE) — <a # rel=nofollow>Fitbit</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FIT) today announced the latest evolution of its most popular family of devices,<sup>1</sup><a # rel=nofollow>Fitbit Charge 4™</a>.

Now with the ability to track your pace and distance in real-time, in addition to the 20+ goal-based exercise modes, you can access seven GPS-enabled exercise modes, including a new outdoor workout mode for any outdoor activity like hiking, running or a brisk walk. After completing a GPS-enabled workout, sync your device for a GPS-powered heat map<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;in the Fitbit app® where you can see your workout intensity, based on your different heart rate zones along your route, to help you visualize and improve how you are performing against different terrain.</p><p style=text-align:justify><b>Active Zone Minutes helps you workout more efficiently and unlock better health</b></p><p style=text-align:justify>Because activity looks different for everyone, Fitbit developed&nbsp;<a # rel=nofollow>Active Zone Minutes</a>&nbsp;to help you understand how your activity contributes to your overall health, beyond the number of steps you take.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>With Fitbit’s PurePulse® 24/7 heart rate tracking, Active Zone Minutes uses your personalized heart rate zones to track your effort for any energizing activity, whether doing a HIIT workout, power yoga or taking a vigorous walk outside.
