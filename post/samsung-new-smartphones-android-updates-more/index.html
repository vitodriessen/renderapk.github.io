Beyond smartphones, Samsung also manufactures and sells laptops, wearables, home appliances, and more.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The company was founded in 1938 as a trading company dealing with local produce, fish, noodles, and more. It wasn’t until the 1960s that Samsung entered the electronics business with its first product, a black and white television. In the 1990s, the company expanded its electronics efforts by producing displays and chips for processing and storage, core components of the business today. In the 2000s, the company established itself as a big player in cell phones, which later evolved into the Samsung Galaxy smartphone lineup.</p><div><h2>Table of contents</h2></div><h2>Why are Samsung smartphones so popular?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Off the back of successful feature phones, Samsung quickly became a dominant player in the smartphone industry. The original Galaxy device was launched in 2009, which ran Android 1.5 “Cupcake” out of the box. Just a year later, the “Galaxy S” brand made its debut, selling 24 million units of its original model and 40 million of its sequel. The Galaxy S III was its first massive hit, though, selling 70 million devices starting in 2012. The success of that mainstream flagship propelled Samsung to be a major player in the premium smartphone market. Today, the <a #>Galaxy S21 series</a> is the company’s main offering starting at $799, but the high-end <a #>Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> pushes boundaries with more raw power and a better camera system that’s <a #>one of the best available today</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;width:100% src=https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/DSC08264.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>The flagship market is only a fraction of the company’s total smartphone sales. It’s actually more affordable devices such as the Galaxy A series that really earn Samsung its spot in the industry. The Galaxy A series has produced some of the best-selling Android smartphones in the world for the past few years, for instance, with <a #>the Galaxy A50</a> and <a #>Galaxy A51</a> both topping the charts in their respective release windows.</p><p style=text-align:justify>To say Samsung’s smartphones have been influential is an understatement, as the brand has produced some of the biggest trends in the industry. Most memorable is the rise of large-screen smartphones. In 2011, just two years into the rise of its Android-based Galaxy line, Samsung debuted the original Galaxy Note, which was ridiculed for its large 5.3-inch display. The phone went on to sell 10 million units and spawn nine popular sequels leading up to the Galaxy Note 20 series in 2020. In 2016, Samsung famously released the Galaxy Note 7, which was recalled due to batteries that were bursting and catching fire. The phone was discontinued, and fans ultimately had to wait until the Note 8 was released a year later. In 2021, Samsung reportedly canceled its Galaxy Note 21 series due to the ongoing chip shortage, a move that may spell trouble for the lineup as a whole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;width:100% src=https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/samsung_galaxy_note_20_ultra_16.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>In 2019, Samsung announced its first foldable smartphone in the Galaxy Fold. The book-style foldable had high-end specs and an inner display that was far larger than what could traditionally fit in a pocket, but its launch was met with negativity as several early reviewers faced major issues with the inner display. The company opted to cancel the launch and redesign the product, relaunching it months later with several solutions. In 2020, the Galaxy Z Flip debuted with much better reception and solutions for problems that plagued the Fold, though with a new flip-phone style design. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 took those same ideas and applied them to the original design while improving the displays both inside and out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;width:100% src=https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/galaxy_foldables_2020.jpg><h2>What other products does Samsung sell?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Beyond its extremely successful smartphones, Samsung sells a plethora of other products. There are TVs, home appliances, and more. The company also products and sells electrical components, AMOLED displays, and more to other companies.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Relating closely to its smartphones, though, are Samsung’s tablets, laptops, and smartwatches. Android tablets are fairly rare on the market, but the Galaxy Tab series has stuck around as an affordable option as well as a flagship one, the latter usually including support for DeX. The company also products laptops using both Microsoft’s Windows 10 and Google’s Chrome OS, the former linking to Galaxy phones using the “Your Phone” integration that is deeply built into One UI. Finally, the Galaxy Watch lineup has been one of the best options for an <a #>Android-compatible smartwatch</a>, and each model pairs best with a Galaxy smartphone.</p><h2>What Samsung smartphones have launched in 2021?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>As the world’s largest smartphone maker, Samsung is known for launching dozens of different models every year. It’s a list that grows considerably throughout the year as flagships, mid-range, and entry-level devices launch in the US, Korea, Europe, India, and other major smartphone markets. Here’s a list of every device that’s launched in 2021 so far.</p><div><div><ul><li>Galaxy S21</li><li>Galaxy S21+</li><li>Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Galaxy A02s</li><li>Galaxy A12</li><li>Galaxy A32</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Galaxy A52</li><li>Galaxy A72</li><li>Galaxy Quantum 2</li><li>Galaxy F02s</li><li>Galaxy F62</li><li>Galaxy F12</li><li>Galaxy F52 5G</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Galaxy M02</li><li>Galaxy M02s</li><li>Galaxy M12</li><li>Galaxy M42 5G</li><li>Galaxy Quantum 2</li><li>Galaxy xCover 5</li></ul></div></div><p style=text-align:justify>You can read more about Galaxy smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches in our cover below.
